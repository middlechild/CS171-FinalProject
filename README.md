===================

### Natacha Fernández, Charles Harrington, Evan Wan

For this project we used the d3 and Boostrap libraries.

#### Run project locally:
This project can run on any webserver, and does not require special commands or compiling steps —just like any other lab/homework. If Webstorm is available, right-click on `index.html -> Run.` Internally, Webstorm will start its own web server for serving the project files.

#### Overview of the html, js, and css files:

* `index.html`:
  This file contains the basic HTML layout for our page. External JS and CSS files are loaded.

* `main.js`:
  This file contains JS code that loads data from various data sources and creates instances of the visualizations.

* `comparisonCharts.js`:
  This file contains code that runs the comparison chart for section-5 of the html file. It creates a comparison chart made of boxes that are dynamically updated via a dropdown box.

* `extinctionRateChart.js`:
  This file contains code that runs the bar chart for section-6 of the html file. It creates a horizontal  bar chart that is dynamically updated via buttons.

* `map3d.js`:
  This file contains code that runs the 3d globe for section-8 of the html file. It creates a globe with regional boundaries with colors that can be dynamically updated via a dropdown box.

* `stackedBarchart.js`:
  This file contains code that runs the stacked barchart for section-8 of the html file. It creates a stacked barchart that can be dynamically updated via a dropdown box.

* `topDownBarchart.js`:
  This file contains code that runs the top down barchart for section-9 of the html file. It creates a vertical barchart that also updates a description section via clicking on the bars.

* `mapFlat.js`:
  This file contains code that runs the flat map for section-13 of the html file. It creates a flat world map with regional boundaries with colors that can be dynamically updated via buttons.

* `utils.js`:
  This file contains code for helper functions for the above js files.

* `style.css`:
  This file contains CSS code.
